## Reflections-Aedan
I was able to complete all user stories as well as the extension. I feel good about my progress, though    
my main point of doubt in my approach at this point in time is related to the most restful      
place to put class methods/instance methods. It makes the most sense to my brain to write instance     
methods that fully leverage the activerecord relationships, but I'm doubtful that those methods      
(for example the extension user story in this challenge) are absolutely fine where I wrote them or      
whether they would be more appropriately placed as a class method in another model. Either way the thing     
works so I'm happy about that.      
Thank you for your time and feedback, I truly try my best to listen and implement it.
